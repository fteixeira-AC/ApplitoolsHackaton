Suggestions and Feedbacks for Applitools:
* There are different documentations about how to use Applitools with WebDriverIO. There are some differences between that maybe can make us confuse of which one is correct. For example, that is a WebDriverIO Service to integrate, there is the documentation in the Applitools site, and also the instructions in the course on Test Automation University. I suggest take a look on those different resources to make more clear which is better for someone starting with Applitools;

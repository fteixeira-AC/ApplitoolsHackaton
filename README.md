## Suggestions and Feedbacks for Applitools:
* There are different documentations about how to use Applitools with WebDriverIO. These differences between them can make us confuse sometimes of which one is better and  more simple to integrate. For example, that is a WebDriverIO Service to integrate, there is the documentation in the Applitools site, and also the instructions in the course on Test Automation University. I suggest take a look on those different resources to make more clear which is better for someone starting with Applitools, and make it easier the adoption when the professional want to use WebDriverIO;

* I have considered using firstly the Applitools service embedded in WebdriverIO configuration (https://webdriver.io/docs/applitools-service.html). This service is the easier to use Applitools with WebDriverIO, and I was able to configure it very fast, however, this service still have many limitations, like for example, configuring batches properly. My suggestion for Applitools team is to take a look on this integration service, and make the necessary improvements. It will be a win-win situation for the clients/users and for Applitools;

* Keep up the good work and congratulations for this hackaton initiative!! :smiley:
